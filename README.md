## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Recently I'm reading the book Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos Lopez de Prado, and I'm inspired by some interesting  contents about how financial data structures help traders to get more information from market. Therefore, I decided to implement it into library so that it can convenient more algo traders, and also as a practice for me!
Hope I can do a great job!

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
